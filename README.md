[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - Allows for a party or operation to be responsible for one tak while the other waits for it to return data to them to process. <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - An attribute that tells a computer system how to interpret its value. <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - A placeholder for something that might change. <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - A local variable has a local scope and references the function or block in which it is declared. A global variable has global scope and is visible/accessible throughout the whole program. A constant is a value that should not be altered by the program during normal execution. <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - The scope is the area of a program where an item that has a name or identifier is recognized. <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - A constant variable is a "variable" which cannot be changed.  <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - In object-oriented programming , a method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class. <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - IRB is interactive Ruby and allows Ruby expressions to interactively execute. <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - Operators are symbols that tell computer programs to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operations. <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - A class is used to describe one or more objects. <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - A Gem is a library of code that provides additonal functionality. These are commonly written by others and shared publicly. <br>

## Part 2

<em>**Conditional**</em> - INSERT DEFINITION HERE <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - An if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. [^1] An else statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is not true. [^2] Elsif allows a block of code to execute if a condition is true but can move on to another statement or statements, including another elseif, if the first condition is not true. [^3] <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements?** </em> - A case statement is a multiway branch statement. It takes the variable used by the when keyword. [^4] When is used to match a single condition. There can be mutliple when statements in a single case statement. [^5]<br>
<em>**What is a data structure?** </em> - A data structure is a specific way to organize & access data. [^6] <rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - Arrays store objects next to each other with no gaps between them. For example: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is an example of an array. [^7] <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - Built-in methods are methods that have already been defined within the Ruby program. You can also define your own methods by using the def keyword. [^8] <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - INSERT DEFINITION HERE <br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - An infinite loop results when a loop is created that never ends. This can happen when using the "loop" keyword and "do...end" block. A "while-true" loop could also result in an infinite loop. [^9] <br>
